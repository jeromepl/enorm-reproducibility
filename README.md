# Reproducibility of Equi-Normalization of Neural Networks

Original paper (under review): https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1gEqiC9FX

Reproducibility study made as part of the [2019 ICLR Reproducibility Challenge](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/iclr_2019/).

This was ran on Google Colab, making use of the free GPU resources available, hence the jupyter notebook format.
